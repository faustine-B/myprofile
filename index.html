            <p>
             I am in my first year at IESEG School of Management and I now live in Lille for my studies. In life I particularly like sports and art. I think that if we give ourselves the means, everything is possible and that we must believe in our dreams. ‚ú®

           <h2>Horse riding üêé</h2>
            <p>
              I have been riding since I was 5 years old and I now compete. I have always loved the feeling of creating a bond with animals, especially horses. Competitions have taught me to have a steely mind and at the same time to be responsible and take care of the animal with which I compete because without it nothing is possible. I came 2nd in the departmental championships and 6th in the French championships this year. I hope to continue riding this year even if I don't have much time left.

           <h2>Piano üéπ</h2>
            <p>
              I have been playing the piano since I was 5 years old at the conservatory. I have my certificate of musical studies and I have had the opportunity to play at several musical events such as the Telethon concert or for concertos and concerts in theaters and conservatories. Playing on stage allows me to manage my stress and at the same time to be in my own world because when I play I forget everything that is happening around me

          <h2>Drawing üñåÔ∏è</h2>
            <p>
              Since I was little, drawing has always been a passion. It all started when I was drawing monsters with my brother in his room. Since then, I haven't stopped drawing. In high school, I took the visual arts option to continue drawing in addition to classes. At home, I still do some sketches when I have time.
